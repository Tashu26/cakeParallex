        <p><span><b>Step 2</b></span><strong>  - Grease and Preheat</strong><br><br>Before you begin baking, grease and flour the pans you are using. 
            These could be 8-inch round pans, 9-inch rounds, a 13" x 9" rectangular sheet, or even a Bundt pan. Then preheat the oven to the 
            temperature as directed in the recipe so that it's

        <p><span><b>Step 3</b></span><strong> - Prepare Your Ingredients</strong><br><br>It's important to have all of the ingredients prepared before 
            making the batter. Many cake recipes call for melted chocolate, so you should do that before beginning to mix up the batter. 
            To melt chocolate, you can use a microwave or a double boiler on the stovetop, the traditional method. <br>
            Other ingredient preparation could include chopping nuts or grating of lemon or orange zest </p>

            When it has reached the proper temperature, beat it until it's creamy. Slowly add the sugar as you cream your butter if using a stand mixer. 
            If you're using an electric beater or mixing by hand, add a little of the sugar at a time and then mix 
            until you have incorporated the full amount.</p>

        <p><span><b>Step 8</b></span><strong> - Pour Your Batter in Your Pan</strong><br><br>If making a layer cake, carefully divide the batter 
            between two round cake pans. If you're using a rectangular or Bundt pan, scoop out all of your batter into your prepared pan of choice. 
            Gently tap the pans on the counter to even the tops and remove air bubbles. If necessary, 
            use a spatula to smooth the tops before baking.</p>

            recipe directions. Remove from the oven and cool on a rack for 10 minutes or as directed in your recipe. Remove the cakes from the 
            pans and cool completely on wire racks before adding frosting. Make sure the top layer isn't upside down on the rack; otherwise, 
            there will be grid lines on 
            the top of the cake.</p>

        <p><span><b>Step 10</b></span><strong> - The Finished Product</strong><br><br>Once the cakes are completely cool, it's time to frost them. 
            Choose from basic buttercream icing, cream cheese frosting, ganache, or whipped cream. If you have two round cakes, put one top 
            side down on the serving platter and frost it. Then put the second cake on top and frost the top and sides. Make swirls as decoration,
             if desired.â€‹</p>
